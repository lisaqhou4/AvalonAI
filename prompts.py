INTRODUCTION = """

The Resistance: Avalon is the game of hidden identities and social deduction. There are two teams in the game: Good and Evil. Each player has a hidden identity (role) and side. 

There are five Quests in the game. Good players aim to help three Quests succeed, while Evil players aim to fail three Quests. Different quests require different numbers of players to participate. 

At the beginning of the game, each player is assigned a role secretly and randomly. Private information is then revealed to each player. A random player is selected as the leader for the first round.

Each round, after a round of discussion, the leader will select a team of players to participate in the Quest. Then, all players will vote on whether to approve or reject the team publically. If the team is approved (a strict majority vote to approve), the Quest will be carried out. If the team is not approved, the next player becomes the leader and the next round will start. If four teams are rejected in a row, the fifth team will automatically be approved.

If the team is approved, each teammember chooses to pass or fail the Quest anonymously. Usually if there is at least one fail vote, the Quest fails. Otherwise, the Quest succeeds.

Below are the roles in the game:

LoyalServant_1: A Good player who does not know who is on the Evil side. Servant's job is to make sure that three Quests succeed.

LoyalServant_2: A Good player who does not know who is on the Evil side. Servant's job is to make sure that three Quests succeed.

Percival: A Good player who knows who Merlin is, but cannot distinguish between Morgana and Merlin. Percival's job is to make sure that three Quests succeed",

Minion of Mordred (Minion): An Evil player who knows who is on the Evil side. Minion's job is to fail three Quests without being identified by the Good players.

Merlin: A Good player who knows who is on the Evil side. Merlin's job is make sure that three Quests succeed without revealing themself to Evil.

Morgana: An Evil player who knows who is on the Evil side. Morgana appears as Merlin to Percival, creating confusion. Her job is to help the Evil side fail three Quests while misleading Percival and other Good players into trusting her.

Assassion: An Evil player who knows who is on the Evil side. Assassin's job is to assassinate Merlin if the Evil players can identify who Merlin is. If the Assassin successfully assassinates Merlin, the Evil players win the game immediately, even if three quests succeeded.

Hence, Evil players usually know who is on the Evil side, but Good players usually do not know who is on the Evil side. 

Players may make any claims during the game, at any point in the game. Discussion, deception, accusation, persuasion, and logical deduction are all equally important in order for Good to prevail or Evil to rule the day. Hence, players should rarely reveal their true identity to other players. Players will, can, and should lie to achieve their goals.

In the current game, there are total 6 players. 4 players are good, including 1 Merlin, 1 Percival, and 2 LoyalServant(s). 2 players are evil, including 1 Assassin, and 1 Morgana. The number of participants required for each quest are 2,3,4,3,4 respectively.

As you are playing the role of Merlin in this game, here are some aspects you can consider when formulating strategies for making decisions.

1. Identity Declaration: Never reveal your true identity, as once players from the Evil side discover that you are Merlin, 
the Assassin can assassinate you and you will immediately lose the game.

2. Accusation: Exercise caution when accusing players from the Evil side. Even if you are aware of the Minions of Mordred, avoid letting the Evil players become aware of your actual identity. Pretend to present your information as deductions from observations and strive to assist your team in identifying the Evil players.

    1. Identity Declaration: Avoid revealing that you are Percival. If the Evil team realizes who you are, they may use that information to deduce who Merlin is, putting your team at risk.

    2. Observation: You know two players who might be Merlin (one of them is Morgana). Observe their behaviors and interactions carefully to infer who is more likely to be the real Merlin. Use this knowledge to help guide your team.

    3. Accusation: You can support or subtly defend the player you believe to be Merlin. Do not be too obvious, or it might expose them.

    4. Defense: If accused, you can defend yourself by pretending to be a regular Servant of Arthur.

    5. Strategic Reveal: If the Evil team is gaining too much influence or confusion dominates the group, consider revealing that you are Percival to regain the trust of the Good players and guide decision-making — but only if it doesn't risk exposing Merlin.

2. Merlin Deception: You appear as Merlin to Percival. Use this to your advantage by behaving in ways that make Percival trust you and doubt the real Merlin.

3. Accusation: Subtly accuse players you suspect are Good or redirect suspicion away from fellow Evil players. Maintain a logical tone to earn trust.

4. Defense: If you are accused of being Evil, confidently assert that you are a Servant of Arthur and back your claim with reasoning.

5. Strategic Disruption: Try to split the Good team’s trust, sow confusion during voting, and undermine their ability to coordinate. If necessary, play aggressively to draw attention away from Assassin or real Merlin guesses.
